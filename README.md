# Connecticut-Charging-Stations-Project
Tyler Gilbert and Sina Sharifi decided to analyze a dataset related to charging stations for electric vehicles from the state of Connecticut. We were curious to see how popular electric vehicles were and how common charging stations were in the area.  We hope to illustrate the frequency and availability of these charging stations throughout the state with interactive charts and a leaflet inspired mapping of the area.  Hereâ€™s the link to our dataset: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-charging-stations
