# Connecticut-Charging-Stations-Project
Project 2 Proposal  Tyler and I decided to analyze a dataset related to charging stations for electric vehicles from the state of Connecticut. We were curious to see how popular electric vehicles were and how common charging stations were in the area. There was no real reason for choosing Connecticut apart from it being the only dataset that fit what we were looking for.  We hope to illustrate the frequency and availability of these charging stations throughout the state with interactive charts and a leaflet inspired mapping of the area.  Hereâ€™s the link to our dataset: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-charging-stations
